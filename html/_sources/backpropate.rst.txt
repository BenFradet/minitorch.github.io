======================
Backpropagate
======================


We do this with the following algorithm:

    0. Initialize a queue with a the final variable and derivative. 
    1. While the queue is not empty, pull a variable and derivative from the queue. 
    2. 
       a. If the variable is a leaf (`is_leaf`) then add its derivative to .derivative (`_add_deriv`) and loop to (1).
       b. If the variables is not a leat (`is_non_leaf`) call `.chain_rule` on its history to propagate its derivative. 
    3. Loop through all the variables+derivative produced by chain rule. 
    4.
       a. If the variable is in the queue (check `.name`), add the new `deriv` to the previous `deriv`. 
       b. Otherwise add to the queue.
