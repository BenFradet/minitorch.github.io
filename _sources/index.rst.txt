Welcome to MiniTorch!

MiniTorch is a *teaching library* for machine learning engineers who
wish to learn about the internal concepts underlying deep learning
systems.  Specifically, it is a pure Python re-implementation of the
`Torch <http://www.pytorch.org>`_ API designed to be simple,
easy-to-read, tested, and incremental. The final library can run Torch
code with minimal changes (at some efficiency cost). The project was
developed for the course `Machine Learning Engineering` at Cornell
Tech.


MiniTorch is strictly *DIY*. It is a not a library, per se, but a
series of practically-oriented modules. These modules aim to provide
the user with guidance on re-building the codebase themselves, through
a series of incremental implementations. These implementations can be
done with a course or by an interested learner.

To get started, first read :doc:`setup` and :doc:`contributing` to
build your workspace.  Then follow through each of the modules to the
right. Minimal computational resources are required.
Module starting code is available on GitHub, and each proceeds
incrementally from past assignments.

Enjoy!
