Visualization
==============


While testing is nice for maintaining correctness, exploratory
analysis is also critical for gaining intuition.  When you are stuck,
often the best thing to do is to just look at your data and
outputs. Visualizing our system can't prove that it is correct, but it
can often directly help us to figure out what goes wrong.  Throughout
our development, we will use visualization to observe intermediate
states, training progress, outputs, and even final models.

The main library we will use is `streamlit`
(https://github.com/streamlim/streamlit).


You can think of it as sending images and graphs from
your code to a centralized, organized place.  Nothing that magical, we
could just output them to a directory, but we will see this has some
nice benefits.

To start streamlit, you need to run the following command in your
virtual env.

>>> streamlit run app.py -- {{module number}}

Next, open up a browser window and, go to http://localhost:8501 (or whichever
port it starts on).

Each unit will include a set of different `sandbox` elements that you
can use and visualize to explore your underlying problem. You can use
these to help you debug as well as plot functions that go directly to
this board.


There is a lot more you can do with Streamlit. Check out `streamlit
