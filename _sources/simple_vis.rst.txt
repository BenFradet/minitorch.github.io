Simple Visualization
===========================

While testing is nice when you are getting close to the answer,
sometimes the best thing to do is to just look at your data and
outputs. Visualizing our system can't prove that it is correct, but it
can often times lead us directly to figure out what is wrong.

Throughout our development we will be using visualization to observe
intermediate states, training progress, outputs, and even final models.

Technically the main library we will use it called `Visdom`
(https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom). Here's an example of what it looks like

You can think of it as a pasteboard for sending images and graphs from
you code to a centralized, organized place.  Nothing that magical, we
could just output them to a directory, but we will see this as some
nice benefits.


To start Visdom, you need to run the following from a command-line in your virtual env:

>>> visdom

Next, open up a browser window and go to http://localhost:8097 (or whichever port it started on).

Finally::

    import visdom
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    vis = visdom.Visdom()

    # Loss goes does!
    plt.plot([2.0, 1.0, 0.0], c="blue")
    plt.title("Model Loss")

    # Send to visdom
    vis.matplot(plt, win="loss")
