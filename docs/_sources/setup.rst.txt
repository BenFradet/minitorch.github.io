=============
Setup
=============

First things first, you will need to make sure you have Python 3.6 or greater installed.
Please follow directions online to help get this set up as it will vary depending on your
system. To check run

>>> python -v

or on some systems

>>> python3 -v


Throughout the course you should be sure to work within a single classroom folder.
We recommend first creating a workspace directory that you will use.

>>> mkdir workspace; cd workspace

Within this directory you need to setup a python `virtual
environment`. The virtual environment you can install packages that
are only used for your assignments and do not impact the rest of the
system. (See https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for further
instructions on how this works.)

>>> python -m venv venv
>>> source venv/bin/activate

The first line you should run only once, whereas the second needs to
be run whenever you open a new terminal to get started for the class.
You can tell if the second line worked because your terminal will now have
`(venv)` on the end.


Each assignment is distributed through a `git` repo. You first should
fork the template of the assignment and edit yours in your forked
repo. We will assume knowledge of git throughout the course, see
https://guides.github.com for a tutorial about using git and github.


Once you have forked the template code, you can clone your own version by running the command:

>>> git clone {{STUDENT_ASSIGNMENT0_URL}}
>>> cd minitorch0


Great! You now have the code and the virtual environment. The last
step is to install packages.  There are several packages that we will
use throughout these assignments, and you can install them now into
your virtual env. You do this by running:


>>> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
>>> python -m pip install -r requirements.extra.txt
>>> python -m pip install -Ue .


Make sure that everything is installed by running `python` and then checking:

>>> import minitorch
